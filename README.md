## Build instructions

This repo contains code for several userscripts, split into specific sub directories.

### LowLvlAttackDetector

Used for detecting incoming attacks from lower leveled players in an ongoing attack.
Run these commands to build the dist file:

```
npm install
npm run build

This will produce a `dist` directory containing `LowLvlAttackDetector.user.js`.
Open the file and install to Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey and you're ready to go!
